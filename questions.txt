A) If I were a software developer either with SFPO or Airbnb.com, I would implement access to a database within SFPO.
The database would have to include fips codes or some other determining factor for which locales would need proper licensing.
Develop an API so that we can talk back and forth to verify license numbers. If there isn't a validation process in place, I
would work with both teams to implement one. Verifying a set length of alphanumeric characters in a pattern (cue regex) as
well as matching with SFPO's database.
Arguments: Airbnb may not want to implement this and put it off as SFPO's responsibility. As Airbnb could lose listers that
need to comply. Or they may say that we've violated ToS. SFPO may not want to put the resources into this development and
could see this as a violating of ToS with Airbnb.

B) What is the correlation between the number of Airbnb listings in a concentrated area and the value of homes?
They may raise the values of homeowners but may very well hinder future buyers. Or vice versa. Or if there are
listers that have homes rented out for long periods in relation to inadequate housing for those searching.

C) I think that if you partake in web scraping, as long as the information is available in the code found on a public
website, there is no harm. If you find a vulnerability and exploit it, if warned, weigh your pros and cons. Maybe see
if there's a bug bounty before you back off. But, if you are going after private or encrypted information that you have
to work towards 'breaking into', we broke the ethical plane.

D) If it puts anyone at risk of harm or exploitation, don't get involved. And we should consider systemic patterns at
all times to make sure we separate ourselves from that and continue on an ethical path.
